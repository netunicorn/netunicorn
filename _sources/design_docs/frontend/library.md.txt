# Library
Library is a package that would contain implementations of tasks and DAGs for different research problems.

This package is to be most updated and also partially community-based - other researchers can freely propose pull requests and provide their own implementations of different tasks and DAGs. 

## Functional requirements
- Library must allow user to import and reuse tasks or DAGs
## Non-functional requirements
- Library should establish a good and flexible package structure to prevent mess inside
## Design
Library is a single stateless Python library, that uses system-common package for common abstractions.
